# Myopia Research

The aim of this project is to collect evidence based information on preventing, slowing or curing myopia (short-sightedness/near-sightedness). As well as promoting awareness of the issue to incite change.

It seems there is current evidence not being acted upon by optometrists, government and everyday people.
