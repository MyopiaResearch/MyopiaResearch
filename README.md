# Myopia Research

The aim of this project is to collect evidence based information on preventing, slowing or curing myopia (short-sightedness/near-sightedness). As well as promoting awareness of the issue to incite change.

It seems there is current evidence not being acted upon by optometrists, government and everyday people.

## The Importance of Short Wavelength Light

### Violet Light

**NOTE**: Violet light is known to cause damage such as age-related macular degeneration and cataracts.

### Violet Light Exposure Can Be a Preventive Strategy Against Myopia Progression | [Article](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ebiom.2016.12.007)

- Violet light (360–400 nm wavelengths) suppressed the axial length elongation both in a chick myopia model and in human.
- The myopia suppressive gene EGR1 was upregulated by the violet light exposure.
- Violet light, one of the myopia suppressive factors in the outdoor environment, is deficient from our modern society.

### Violet Light Transmission is Related to Myopia Progression in Adult High Myopia | [Article](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-09388-7)

- High myopic patients with the non-VL transmitting pIOLs (phakic intraocular lens) implanted are almost two times more myopic in the change of refraction and four times longer in the change of axial length, compared to those implanted with the VL transmitting pIOLs.
- VL transmitting pIOL suppressed myopia progression and axial length elongation compared with the non-VL transmitting one. In conclusion, our study showed the VL possibly has an anti-myopia effect for human adults with high myopia.
